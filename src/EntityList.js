    },
  ],
  "diagnosis": "Cataracts",
  "contemporaryTheory": "In the 17th century, cataracts were often believed to be caused by a buildup of 'cold and phlegmatic' humors clouding the eyes. Treatments typically involved draining these excess humors or using salves made from herbs and minerals. Cataracts were often linked to aging or prolonged exposure to harsh conditions, including bright sunlight or dust.",
  "socialContext": "Gonzalo, once enslaved and now a freedman innkeeper, has worked hard to establish his business in Mexico City. However, his declining vision threatens his livelihood, as he struggles to manage the inn and serve his guests. His status as a former slave makes seeking medical care difficult, and many of his peers view his condition as a sign of aging or fate. Gonzalo, once proud of his independence, is now dependent on others to navigate his daily tasks.",

  "description": "Gonzalo, a 38-year-old freedman from Angola, now works as an innkeeper in Mexico City. After years of labor and exposure to harsh conditions, he developed cataracts, clouding his vision and leaving him with constant eye pain. His health is deteriorating, and his ability to manage the inn is at risk.",
  "astrologicalSign": "Libra",

  "citation": "Gonzalo is a fictionalized composite based partially on patients discussed in Pablo Gomez's book *The Experiential Caribbean.*",
  "secret": "Gonzalo has secretly been using more and more opium to dull the pain in his eyes, despite knowing it might cloud his mind further.",
  "imgdescription": "A highly detailed pixel art portrait of Gonzalo de Loanda, a 38-year-old African-born innkeeper in Mexico City, 1680. His once sharp eyes are now cloudy with cataracts, and his face shows signs of strain and fatigue. He wears a simple linen shirt, and his posture suggests someone used to hard work, though now burdened by his fading sight.",
  "treatment": "Maria may suggest using a preparation of **rosewater** and **alum** as eye drops to reduce the inflammation and cloudiness. For pain relief, she might offer **poppy seeds** or **opium tincture** in controlled doses. She could also advise Gonzalo to rest his eyes and avoid bright lights, recommending a simple **linen blindfold** soaked in cool herbal infusions to soothe the irritation.",
  "ability": "If Maria successfully relieves Gonzalo's symptoms, he will become a loyal ally and provide a safe place for her to stay when needed. He will also direct other clients her way, raising her reputation among freedmen and laborers in Mexico City."

  "contemporaryTheory": "The symptoms are believed to arise from a surplus of cold, phlegmatic humors in the body, which leads to melancholia, apoplexy, and paralysis.",
  "socialContext": "Doña Michaela's condition has been a growing concern for her household and social circle. As the wife of a wealthy hacendado, she is expected to manage the domestic affairs of their estate, but her declining health has made it difficult for her to fulfill these responsibilities. There is fear among her family that her fainting spells and exhaustion may be perceived as signs of hysteria, a condition often associated with women of her status.

Her face is pale, with dark circles under her eyes, and her posture hints at her exhaustion. She wears a finely embroidered pearl white gown, though her once bright expression now appears wearied and anxious.",
  "treatment": "Maria may suggest a regimen of **Salt of Mallow** and **Hysteric Water** to dissolve the thick, cold humors clogging Doña Michaela’s body. Salt of Mallow can be given six grains at a time, administered with water to clear the phlegm from her lungs. To restore her strength and calm her nerves, Maria might recommend ten drops of **Hysteric Water**, a complex distillation of herbs like saffron, sage, and marjoram, combined with Volatile Salts of Amber and Deer Antlers. Cooling compresses soaked in **Water of the Queen of Hungary** can be applied to her forehead during fainting spells, while **Cinnamon Water** will help to strengthen her heart and stomach.",
  "ability": "If Maria successfully treats Doña Michaela’s illness, she will recommend Maria’s services to other elite women in Mexico City. This can open up new opportunities for Maria to gain influence in the elite circles of the city and be invited to attend prestigious social gatherings, where additional quests may be found."

  "socialContext": "Sir Robert Southwell is a high-ranking diplomat sent to New Spain to negotiate crucial trade agreements. His illness is an unfortunate consequence of traveling through swampy regions where bad air lingers. His illness is worsening, and the success of his mission depends on his recovery.

  "citation": "Sir Robert Southwell was a real historical figure, as documented in multiple sources, including John Aubrey's *Brief Lives* and various records of the Royal Society, of which he was a key member. His mission to New Spain and illness from malaria are fictional adaptations for the game.",

  "imgdescription": "A highly detailed pixel art portrait of Sir Robert Southwell, a 44-year-old diplomat in New Spain in 1680. His pale skin is flushed with fever, and beads of sweat are visible on his brow. He has dark circles under his eyes, and his normally sharp features are softened by exhaustion. He wears a fine dark coat with gold buttons, but it hangs loosely on his frame, as if the fever is draining the life from him.",
  "treatment": "Maria may suggest quinine bark (cinchona) to help alleviate the fever and chills associated with malaria. She advises Sir Robert to rest as much as possible, drink infusions of chamomile and mint to calm his stomach, and take small doses of cinchona bark powder mixed with honey to reduce the fever. Cooling compresses soaked in rosewater can be applied to his forehead to relieve the headache.",
  "ability": "If Maria offers a good prescription or engages him in conversation, he will invite her to return with him to England and speak before the Royal Society of London. If pursued, develop this as an experience for the player and depict 1680 London in detail."

  "contemporaryTheory": "In the 17th century, heart palpitations and fainting spells were often attributed to an imbalance of the humors, particularly an excess of heat or dryness. Stress and anxiety, especially for someone engaged in constant intellectual work, were believed to contribute to these symptoms.",
  "socialContext": "Sor Juana’s condition is a source of private concern, especially given her high intellectual and social status. Her reputation as a genius requires her to constantly maintain her mental acuity, and this illness threatens to undermine her ability to perform in the court and convent. She is wary of the illness becoming widely known, as it could be used by her critics to suggest that her intellectual pursuits are detrimental to her health and therefore unnatural for a woman.",

  "secret": "Sor Juana suspects that her illness may have psychological roots—her anxieties about her writings, her position in the Church, and the constant pressure she faces to prove her intellect weigh heavily on her mind. She is secretly considering leaving the convent altogether.",
  "imgdescription": "A highly detailed pixel art portrait of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, a 28-year-old nun and poet in Mexico City, 1680. She is dressed in the black and white habit of the Hieronymite order, her face pale and strained, though her eyes remain sharp with intellectual fervor. A quill rests in her hand, and open books surround her, though her posture suggests she is battling some unseen discomfort.",
  "treatment": "Maria might prescribe **hawthorn berries** or **motherwort**, herbs known for their ability to regulate heart rhythms and calm nervous disorders. Additionally, **chamomile** or **lemon balm** could be recommended to ease the anxiety and tension that are likely contributing to her symptoms. Maria may also advise Sor Juana to moderate her study and writing to prevent further strain on her body.",
  "ability": "If Maria successfully treats Sor Juana’s symptoms and gains her trust, Sor Juana will compose a special poem or letter praising Maria’s skill and insight. This poem, circulated among the intellectual and courtly elites, can enhance Maria’s reputation dramatically within Mexico City. As a result, the player will be offered new quests involving high-ranking patrons or gain access to influential figures in the viceregal court."

He wears a simple brown doublet and breeches, with a leather apron bearing the stains and scorch marks of his trade. A fine tremor is visible in his hands and jaw, and he squints as if in pain.",
treatment: "The author advised Pancho to shave his head and wear a cap lined with fine gold leaf, which would draw out the mercury from his body. He also instructed him to insert small plugs of gold leaf into his nostrils and mouth. As the gold blackened, it was replaced, gradually leaching the mercury from his system and relieving his symptoms. The author cites this case as proof of gold's ability to extract mercury from the body and counteract its toxic effects."

His disorderly conduct, spasms, and incidents of clairvoyance have raised concerns, culminating in accusations of being an 'iluso y alumbrado' (deluded and illuminated).
